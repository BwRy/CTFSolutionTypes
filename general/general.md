## Read the instructions extremely carefully 

- The instructions often have major clues in the wording of the task itself. Read it as if the answer is present in the text.

## Look for clues on the page

- There are often clues in the content that is being displayed. Include pictures in your review for clues.

## Check your tools

- If the challenge requires the use of tools, like grep, or some other utility or application, and the challenge depends on those translation steps working correctly, *make sure the tools are working properly*. Instead of changing your approach immediately, try the tool on another browser, another platform, etc.
